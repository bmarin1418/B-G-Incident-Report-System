Steps to add a new location to the system

1. In firebase under the authentication tab, add a new login and password for staff members as well as an admin.

2. Copy the UID of the staff member and in the database under the JSON key uid (it's on the first level). Add a key-value pair with key $LOCATION_staff_uid and the corresponding uid as the value. For the admin uid, add a key-value pair in the same location with key $LOCATION_admin_uid and the copied uid as the value.

3. Go into the allFormPages.js file in the code and look at the funciton getClub(). Add a case that return $LOCATION.
